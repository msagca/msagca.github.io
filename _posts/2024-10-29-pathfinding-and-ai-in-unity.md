title: Pathfinding and AI in Unity
---

Following my experiments with procedural map generation, I wanted to see some action on the maps I generated. So, I decided to add agents to the scene to observe how they navigate through the map. And, in order to make it look more interesting, I wanted the agents to behave intelligently and perform certain tasks.

For navigation, I decided not to use Unity's [AI navigation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.ai.navigation@2.0/manual) package because I wanted to implement it myself. I specifically wanted to learn about the _A\* pathfinding_ algorithm and integrate it into my project. I found this amazing [video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cq5Umv3pMC9SPnKjfp9eGW) by Sebastian Lague to learn how to implement the algorithm. Since my terrain was created from point samples generated by _Poisson Disk Sampling_, it wasn't a grid, so I needed to adapt the code in the tutorial to arbitrary graphs. The transformation seemed straightforward: the most noticeable difference between a grid, which is a special kind of graph, and the graph that represented my procedurally generated terrain was that the nodes in my graph can have arbitrary number of neighbors. However, it wasn't going to be that simple, because the game's poor performance in the case of many pathfinding requests would force me to parallelize pathfinding.

Running pathfinding tasks in parallel implied that I had to use Unity's [job system](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/job-system.html) to enable multithreaded code execution. This meant that I had to convert my _A\* pathfinding_ implementation to a struct that implemented the [IJob](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJob.html) interface. In addition to this, I had to get rid of all the managed (â‰ˆ garbage collected) objects that the job used and switch to [thread-safe types](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/job-system-native-container.html) because the [Burst compiler](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.8/manual/index.html) doesn't support managed types.

The first change I made was to convert the managed node class that represented the vertices of my graph to a struct. Since the terrain is generated at the start of the game and it remains the same throughout runtime, the node positions could be made read-only. For pathfinding, I only needed to use the position on the xz-plane since the point samples were initially contained within a 2D disk on this plane and later assigned an elevation (`y`) value using [Perlin Noise](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Mathf.PerlinNoise.html). I also needed the 3D positions of the nodes for placing objects at these locations. So, I decided to declare three fields (`x`, `y` and `z`) and define two properties (`Pos2` and `Pos3`) that would return the 2D and 3D positions, respectively. In addition to the coordinates and positions, I also added an index field to facilitate the lookup of nodes. The `GraphNode` struct ended up looking like this:

```cs
public readonly struct GraphNode : IEquatable<GraphNode> {
  public readonly int index;
  public readonly float x;
  public readonly float y;
  public readonly float z;
  public readonly Vector2 Pos2 => new(x, z);
  public readonly Vector3 Pos3 => new(x, y, z);
  public readonly bool Equals (GraphNode other) => index == other.index;
  // ...
}
```

The _A\* pathfinding_ algorithm requires three values: `g` is the cost from the start node to the current node, `h` is the heuristic cost from the current node to the end node, and `f` is the sum of `g` and `h`. It begins by exploring the neighbors of the `start` node and stores them in the **open** list, sorted by their `f` values in an ascending order (lowest `f` cost first). A node whose every neighbor has been visited is moved to the **closed** list. Then, a new node is taken from the **open** list until the `end` node is added to the **closed** list. If the algorithm discovers a shorter path to any node in the **open** list during its execution, it updates the `g` cost of that node which results in an updated `f` cost. Hence, the **open** list should be able to efficiently reorder the nodes in the case of an update, which I will discuss later. For the algorithm to be able to trace the path backwards to construct the path after the `end` node has been reached, each node must point to the neighbor with the lowest `g` cost to indicate which step was taken; hence, another field (named `parent`) is required to store a reference to this neighboring node. Remember that this reference cannot be a pointer to a class instance since we're not allowed to use managed types.

You may be wondering why I didn't include the cost fields in the `GraphNode` struct. Notice that these costs are different for every pathfinding request that has a different start and end point, which means every job needs its own copy of the graph. Remember that the terrain, hence the node positions, is the same for each job. Storing both the positions and the costs in the same struct would result in unnecessary duplication of the coordinate values which did not change. So, it made more sense to define a separate struct to store the costs and other pathfinding related data that differed from job to job. The nodes that stored the positions could be shared between jobs (more on that later). With the addition of couple other fields that are implementation specific, the `PathNode` struct turned out like this:

```cs
public struct PathNode : IEquatable<PathNode>, IComparable<PathNode> {
  public readonly int index;
  public int parent;
  public bool isExplored;
  public bool isObstacle;
  public float g;
  public float h;
  public readonly float F => g + h;
  public readonly bool Equals (PathNode other) => index == other.index;
  public readonly int CompareTo (PathNode other) => other.F.CompareTo(value: F); // reverse the order so that lower F means higher priority
  // ...
}
```

The `index` value of a `PathNode` must be equal to the index of the corresponding `GraphNode` for convenience. The `parent` field is an integer that is the index of the neighboring node where a candidate path passes through. Even though I wanted to use a set to store the explored nodes (or indices), I opted to add a field called `isEplored` to indicate if a node has been explored, which I will explain later. I also added a field called `isObstacle` to indicate if the node is an obstacle because the map could contain trees. But the map was not supposed to change, hence the tree positions; so, why not include this field in the `GraphNode` struct? Because, tree positions are determined at a later stage after the nodes are constructed, and I thought I could add dynamic obstacles to the scene in the future. The [CompareTo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable.compareto?view=net-8.0) method of the [IComparable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.icomparable?view=net-8.0) interface for the `float` type in the expression `a.CompareTo(b)` returns greater than `0` if `a` is greater than `b` and vice versa; it returns `0` if they are equal. In my **open** list implementation, I sort items based on priority in a descending order (highest priority at the top). So, I implemented the `CompareTo` method in a way that returns greater than `0` when `a` has a lower `f` cost (higher priority) than `b`.

Now, it's time to clear up the things I left unexplained in the preceding paragraphs. They are either related to the native container types that come with the [Collections](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@2.5/manual/index.html) package or [custom containers](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/job-system-custom-nativecontainer.html) created by myself. These containers are thread-safe and can be used for data that is shared between a worker thread and the main thread.

Recall that the graph, which represents the terrain, is constant and can be shared between threads. [NativeArray](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.html) is the container I used to store `GraphNode` instances that constitute the terrain. This same array (`graphNodes`) is passed to the constructor of each `PathfindingJob` instance that is created. For this to work properly, and to receive appropriate warnings/errors when a job attempts to write to this container, it is required to add the [ReadOnly](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.ReadOnlyAttribute.html) attribute before the field declaration in the job definition that references this graph. The array itself is created by the main thread in a [MonoBehaviour](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html) instance which is also responsible for disposing of it (by calling its [Dispose](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.NativeArray_1.Dispose.html) method) once it's no longer needed, to prevent memory leaks. This array is created using the [Persistent](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.Allocator.Persistent.html) allocator since its lifetime exceeds the four frame limit of the [TempJob](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.Allocator.TempJob.html) allocator. The edges of this graph are stored in a [NativeParallelMultiHashMap](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@2.5/api/Unity.Collections.NativeParallelMultiHashMap-2.html) of type `<int, int>` where the key is the index of a node and the value is a set that contains the indices of the node's neighbors. This structure (`graphEdges`) is also created and handled the same way `graphNodes` is.

There can also be containers that are local to the job struct. These are allocated and deallocated by the job itself. Remember that the **open** list had to efficiently sort and store the `PathNode` instances. The pathfinding tutorial by Sebastian Lague also touches on this topic, and the data structure that is used for this job is a [heap](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)>), specifically a max heap since higher priority nodes are at the top of the heap. However, the implementation in the tutorial could not be used in a job since it must be a native container. So, I had to convert that implementation to a `NativeHeap` by looking at the [examples](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/job-system-custom-nativecontainer-example.html), and I was successful in doing so after some trial and error. The constructor of this custom native container looks like the following.

```cs
[NativeContainer]
[NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletion]
public unsafe struct NativeHeap<T> : IDisposable where T : unmanaged, IEquatable<T>, IComparable<T> {
  public NativeHeap (int initialCapacity, Allocator allocator) {
#if ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS
    m_Safety = AtomicSafetyHandle.Create();
    AtomicSafetyHandle.SetStaticSafetyId(handle: ref m_Safety, staticSafetyId: s_staticSafetyId);
    AtomicSafetyHandle.SetBumpSecondaryVersionOnScheduleWrite(handle: m_Safety, value: true);
#endif
    capacity = initialCapacity;
    if (capacity <= 0)
      capacity = 16;
    m_Length = 0;
    m_AllocatorLabel = allocator;
    m_Buffer = (T*)UnsafeUtility.MallocTracked(size: capacity * UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<T>(), alignment: UnsafeUtility.AlignOf<T>(), allocator, callstacksToSkip: 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

It is possible to add the [DeallocateOnJobCompletion](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.DeallocateOnJobCompletionAttribute.html) attribute before the declaration of the field of type `NativeHeap` in the job struct so that the job system automatically deallocates the container when the job is finished. For this to work, the custom container implementation must have the [NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletion](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletionAttribute.html) attribute and comply with the requirements specified in the description page of this attribute. Recall that I had to add a field called `isEplored` to the `PathNode` struct because I could not use a [NativeHashSet](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@2.5/api/Unity.Collections.NativeHashSet-1.html) for the **closed** list. The reason is that this native container does not support the `DeallocateOnJobCompletion` attribute, and I did not want to manually dispose of it inside the [Execute](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.IJob.Execute.html) method of the job to keep it clean of code that is not directly related to the pathfinding algorithm itself. The fields of `PathfindingJob` are as follows:

```cs
public struct PathfindingJob : IJob {
  [DeallocateOnJobCompletion] NativeHeap<PathNode> queue;
  [ReadOnly] readonly NativeArray<GraphNode> graphNodes;
  [ReadOnly] readonly NativeParallelMultiHashMap<int, int> graphEdges;
  NativeArray<PathNode> pathNodes;
  NativeList<GraphNode> path;
  readonly PathEndpoints endpoints;
  // ...
}
```

The `PathEndpoints` struct is a pair of integers that specify the start and end node indices. The `path` is a [NativeList](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@2.5/api/Unity.Collections.NativeList-1.html) created outside the job and filled in during its execution. It is not created in the job's local scope so it can be accessed later, after calling [Complete](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.Complete.html) on the [JobHandle](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Unity.Jobs.JobHandle.html). The `queue` is the **open** list, which is a priority queue implemented as a heap.

Before diving into how the pathfinding requests are handled, it is necessary to describe how they are created. These requests come from agents that display intelligent behaviour such as following other agents and destroying them, which brings us to artificial intelligence, but not in the form of a neural network. I wanted something simple since the behaviour I wanted to observe consisted of a few basic actions. I found behaviour trees to be more suitable in my case compared to state machines or goal oriented action planning. I've found this nice [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR6wt5BlE-E) by Mina PÃªcheux to learn about the basics and see how it's implemented. My implementation looked more or less the same: I defined a `LeafNode` class and two composite node classes (`SelectorNode` and `SequenceNode`) that extend this class. To facilitate passing of data between the nodes of a behaviour tree, I implemented a basic `Blackboard` class and let all the nodes refer to a common instance. This class defines two dictionaries, one for the information that is being stored and one for the observers that will be notified when certain information is updated. I limited the number of observers for each key to one, which was enough for my purposes.

```cs
public sealed class Blackboard {
  readonly Dictionary<string, object> data = new();
  readonly Dictionary<string, Action> subs = new();
  public void Subscribe (string key, Action callback) {
    if (!subs.ContainsKey(key))
      subs[key] = null;
    subs[key] += callback;
  }
  public void Unsubscribe (string key, Action callback) {
    if (subs.ContainsKey(key))
      subs[key] -= callback;
  }
  // ...
}
```

The root node of an agent's behaviour tree is a `SequenceNode` which has four children that define all the actions that an agent can perform. These actions are detecting a target, finding a path to the target, moving towards the target by following the path, and attacking the target. They are evaluated in sequence, and if any one of them does not succeed, the remaining nodes are skipped. These behaviours are all defined in separate classes that extend the `LeafNode` class. This tree is evaluated in the `Update` method of the agent's `MonoBehaviour` class. The `Start` and `Update` methods of this class are given below.

```cs
public sealed class AgentBehaviour : MonoBehaviour {
  // ...
  void Start () {
    var detectTarget = new DetectTarget(blackboard, transform, getClosestEnemy: playerEvents.GetClosestEnemy, scanInterval: gameSettings.targetScanInterval);
    var findPath = new FindPath(blackboard, transform, requestPath: playerEvents.RequestPath);
    var followPath = new FollowPath(blackboard, transform, moveSpeed: gameSettings.unitMoveSpeed, attackRange: gameSettings.unitAttackRange);
    var attackTarget = new AttackTarget(blackboard, transform, attackRange: gameSettings.unitAttackRange, initiateAttack: playerEvents.InitiateAttack);
    behaviourTree = new SequenceNode(blackboard, detectTarget, findPath, followPath, attackTarget);
  }
  void Update () {
    behaviourTree.Evaluate();
  }
}
```

Here, `gameSettings` and `playerEvents` are [ScriptableObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/Manual/class-ScriptableObject.html) instances that store the game parameters and gameplay related actions, respectively. Agents need to trigger certain actions to perform some of their tasks that require collaboration from other scripts. For example, they do not know about each other by design; hence, they have to trigger an [Action](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.action?view=net-8.0) at a fixed interval (unless there is already a valid target) in order to get the [Transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Transform.html) component of the enemy that is closest to them. As a result, these delegates are passed to any tree node that needs to trigger them. One such action is `RequestPath` of type `Action<Vector2, Vector2, Action<GraphNode[]>>` that is defined in `PlayerEvents`. Here is the `FindPath` node where these requests are made:

```cs
public sealed class FindPath : LeafNode {
  // ...
  public FindPath (Blackboard blackboard, Transform transform, Action<Vector2, Vector2, Action<GraphNode[]>> requestPath) : base(blackboard) {
    // ...
    blackboard.Subscribe(key: "Destination", callback: OnDestinationUpdated);
  }
  ~FindPath () {
    blackboard.Unsubscribe(key: "Destination", callback: OnDestinationUpdated);
  }
  void OnDestinationUpdated () {
    pathFound = false;
    findPath = true;
    destination = blackboard.GetData<Vector2>(key: "Destination");
    var pos2 = new Vector2(x: transform.position.x, y: transform.position.z);
    requestPath?.Invoke(pos2, destination, OnPathFound);
  }
  void OnPathFound (GraphNode[] path) {
    findPath = false;
    pathFound = true;
    blackboard.SetData(key: "Path", value: path);
  }
  public override NodeState Evaluate () {
    if (pathFound)
      return NodeState.Success;
    if (findPath)
      return NodeState.Busy;
    return NodeState.Failure;
  }
}
```

Now, let's see how these requests are handled. The `RequestPath` invocation requires three arguments: agent position, target position and a delegate to the method that will process the returned path. At the receiving end of these requests, there is a queue that stores them. This is crucial because attempting to process all the requests as they arrive would cause poor performance when there are many such requests in the duration of one frame. Instead, they are processed in batches such that in each frame at most `n` requests are removed from the queue and `n` pathfinding jobs are run. The following code schedules jobs that will be executed in parallel by worker threads on multiple CPU cores. A copy of the `pathNodes` is created for each job since it contains information about the obstacles on the terrain. For the special case of batch size of one or a queue with only one item (not included in the code below), the `Temp` allocator is used over `TempJob` for faster allocation, and the job is directly executed (not scheduled).

```cs
var numJobs = Mathf.Min(a: gameSettings.pathfindBatchSize, b: pathRequestQueue.Count);
var jobData = new List<(JobHandle handle, NativeArray<PathNode> pathNodes, NativeList<GraphNode> path, Action<GraphNode[]> handler)>();
for (var i = 0; i < numJobs; i++) {
  var (endpoints, handler) = pathRequestQueue.Dequeue();
  var path = new NativeList<GraphNode>(allocator: Allocator.TempJob);
  var pathNodes = new NativeArray<PathNode>(length: this.pathNodes.Length, allocator: Allocator.TempJob);
  pathNodes.CopyFrom(array: this.pathNodes);
  var job = new PathfindingJob(graphNodes, graphEdges, pathNodes, endpoints, path, allocator: Allocator.TempJob);
  var handle = job.Schedule();
  jobData.Add(item: (handle, pathNodes, path, handler));
}
for (var i = 0; i < jobData.Count; i++) {
  var (handle, pathNodes, path, handler) = jobData[index: i];
  handle.Complete();
  pathNodes.Dispose();
  var pathArr = path.AsArray().Reverse().ToArray();
  path.Dispose();
  handler?.Invoke(obj: pathArr);
}
```

When the path is returned to the `FindPath` node that requested it, it is written to the blackboard which notifies the `FollowPath` node. Then, the agent is moved towards the position of the next `GraphNode` in the path at a constant speed, and this is repeated until it reaches the position of the last node in the array. Index `0` in the path array is the start node which points to the current position of the agent, so the next index should be set to `1` for each new path. If the target is also moving, which is the case here, the path will become invalid as the target starts to get farther away. There is a simple check to determine if the path the agent is currently following will lead to the enemy: calculate the distance from the final node in the path to the enemy and compare it to the distance from the agent's current position to the enemy, if the final node is not closer to the enemy, request a new path. The `Evaluate` method of the `FollowPath` is given below with some parts omitted; `attackRange` is used as the epsilon value for distance comparisons.

```cs
public override NodeState Evaluate () {
  if (path == null)
    return NodeState.Failure;
  var pos3 = transform.position;
  var pos2 = new Vector2(x: pos3.x, y: pos3.z);
  if (target != null) {
    // check if the target is getting away, request a new path if that's the case
  }
  if (nodeIndex > lastIndex)
    return NodeState.Success;
  moveVector = (path[nodeIndex].Pos3 - pos3).normalized;
  transform.Translate(translation: moveSpeed * Time.deltaTime * moveVector);
  if (Vector2.Distance(a: pos2, b: path[nodeIndex].Pos2) < attackRange)
    nodeIndex++;
  return NodeState.Busy;
}
```

Battles between agents are simulated by one script that stores a dictionary whose keys are the `Transform` components of the agents in the scene, and values are `AgentData` instances that contain agent stats such as health points or attack power. When an agent gets close enough to its target, it can initiate an attack by triggering the `InitiateAttack` action which accepts the `Transform` components of the attacker and the defender, respectively. Unlike pathfinding requests, battles are not queueed or executed in batches since they are not computationally heavy. Each battle is started via [StartCoroutine](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.StartCoroutine.html) calls and executed over multiple frames. The attacker gets to hit first, then they take turns. The expression that calculates the damage dealt by the attacker can become very complex as the number of parameters (stats, items, powerups, etc.) increase. If the HP of one side drops to zero, the other side wins. The `Fight` method that is run as a coroutine is given below.

```cs
IEnumerator Fight (TransformPair pair) {
  var attacker = agents[key: pair.A];
  var defender = agents[key: pair.B];
  while (attacker.healthPoints > 0 && defender.healthPoints > 0) {
    var damage = Mathf.RoundToInt(f: attacker.attackPoints * (1f / (defender.defensePoints + 1)) + 1);
    defender.healthPoints -= damage;
    (attacker, defender) = (defender, attacker);
    yield return null;
  }
  battles.Remove(item: pair);
  agents[key: pair.A] = attacker;
  agents[key: pair.B] = defender;
  var loser = attacker.healthPoints > 0 ? pair.B : pair.A;
  // ...
}
```

The pairings are stored in a [HashSet](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1?view=net-8.0) called `battles` to avoid duplicates. However, representing the fighting pairs as a [Tuple](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/value-tuples) would result in `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` being treated as different battles, where `a` and `b` are `Transform` instances. To prevent this, I defined a new type called `TransformPair` that produces the same hash code for the same pair regardless of the order. Once the loser is decided, its entry is removed from the dictionary `agents`, then it can be destroyed or returned to its pool if object pooling is employed (e.g., if there is re-spawn mechanic).

The agents in the scene are rendered via [DrawMeshInstanced](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Graphics.DrawMeshInstanced.html) calls, similar to how I render the trees. I will skip this part since I explained the process in my previous post. To demonstrate the things I covered in this blog post, I spawned 48 agents at random positions and let them perform the actions defined by their behaviour trees. I rendered their active paths via [Gizmos](https://docs.unity3d.com/6000.0/Documentation/ScriptReference/Gizmos.html) for better visualization. To make the scene prettier, I used tree models from the [Low Poly Tree Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vegetation/trees/low-poly-tree-pack-57866) package. The following is the recording of the legendary battles that took place in my procedurally generated map.
